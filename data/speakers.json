    "bio": "Mark Allison is a GDE for Android and software engineer with over 30 years’ experience. He is passionate about providing the user with the best possible experience. He has developed both server and client side, most commonly Android on the client side, but with also for iOS, HTML5, Symbian, and J2ME. Mark writes a technical blog (http://blog.stylingandroid.com) which focuses on Android UI/UX topics, but often covers more general Android development techniques.\n\nWhen not being geeky, Mark likes to unwind by hurling abuse at football referees, specifically those who are unkind to his beloved Watford FC with whom he holds a season ticket. He also has a deep love of spicy food, beer, and malt whisky; and consumes these at every opportunity!\n\nMark is happily married with a grown up step-daughter, and lives in Hertfordshire, UK.",
